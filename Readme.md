## Features

### Data Cleaning

The dataset undergoes a rigorous data cleaning process to ensure accuracy and reliability. This includes handling missing values, addressing outliers, and standardizing data formats, creating a robust foundation for meaningful analysis.

### Visualizations

Diverse and informative visualizations have been crafted to present key findings in an accessible manner. These visualizations encompass various charts, graphs, and dashboards that dynamically showcase trends, distributions, and correlations within the data.

### Averaging Transformation

An essential aspect of this project revolves around the transformation of a single column, originally containing values within a range (e.g., 125-145k). Following meticulous data cleaning procedures, this column was split into two distinct columns, representing the lower and upper bounds of the range. Subsequently, the project computed the average of these values, providing a refined perspective and enhancing the interpretability of the underlying patterns.
